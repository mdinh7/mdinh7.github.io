<p> Click one of the links above to learn more! (Though you should probably look at the parts you need before you build.)
<p> <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/"> A lot of the actual code is likely hidden the large amount of javascript and css used for styling. I only recognize the basic structure. For example, I still see header, footer, the doctype, head and body. This just shows that although the filler may change as we get more advanced, and we can incorporate more things, the basics must still be there for the site to function. The way the site is done, does seem to make both the site and the code seem a lot cleaner than it probably is, especially when compared to my own code.
